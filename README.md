# Water_Potability_Prediction
Using physiochemical measures to predict water potability. 

The dataset was downloaded from kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/water-quality-and-potability/data. 

Preliminary exploration cast suspicion on the provenance of the data. It seems likely that the data were not gathered from real sites and were instead created. 

Multiple methods were used for comparison.
